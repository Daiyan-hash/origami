          <b>Step 1: Start with a square sheet of origami paper, color side down. If you only have regular paper, follow instructions on how to make origami paper.
            Step 2: Fold the paper in half, left to right, and unfold.
            Step 3: Now fold the paper in half again, top to bottom, and unfold again.
        Step 4: Fold the top edge to the center.
        Step 5: Turn the paper over.
            Step 6: Fold the top left and right corners to meet at the middle
            Step 7: Fold the left and right edges to meet at the middle. We'll fold out these flaps next.
        Step 8: Fold about 2/3rds (two thirds) of the left and right flaps out.
        Step 9: Turn the figure over and now you have a rocket!</b>
